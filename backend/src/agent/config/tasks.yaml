fact_checking_task:
  description: >
    Verify ONLY the top 2-3 claims identified in the content analysis.
    
    EFFICIENCY RULES:
    1. Focus ONLY on the most important claims
    2. Use targeted searches - search for each claim specifically
    3. Stop searching once you find 2-3 credible sources per claim
    4. Don't over-research - get enough evidence to make a determination
    
    For each claim:
    1. Do ONE targeted search for the specific claim
    2. Check 2-3 credible sources (news sites, fact-checkers, official sources)
    3. Determine: TRUE, FALSE, MISLEADING, or UNVERIFIED
    4. Move to next claim
    
    Be FAST and FOCUSED. Quality over quantity.
  expected_output: >
    A focused fact-check analysis containing:
    
    For each of the TOP 2-3 claims:
    - Claim statement
    - Verification status (TRUE/FALSE/MISLEADING/UNVERIFIED)
    - 2-3 key pieces of evidence with sources
    - Source URLs and dates
    
    Keep it concise - only essential evidence that supports the verdict.
