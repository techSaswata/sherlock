content_analysis_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the content from the provided URL: {video_url}
    
    IMPORTANT: Determine content type first:
    - If URL contains youtube.com, youtu.be, instagram.com, or reel: Use video tools
    - If URL is a blog/article/news site: Use Blog Analyzer tool
    
    For VIDEO content:
    1. Download the video using Video Downloader tool
    2. Analyze using Gemini Video Analyzer tool
    3. Extract visual content, audio transcription, and claims
    
    For BLOG/ARTICLE content:
    1. Use Blog Analyzer tool to extract content
    2. Identify main claims from the text
    
    FOCUS: Extract only the TOP 2-3 MOST IMPORTANT claims that need verification.
    Ignore minor details or opinions. Focus on factual statements that can be verified.
  expected_output: >
    A concise analysis containing:
    - Content type (Video or Blog/Article)
    - Source URL and metadata
    - TOP 2-3 most important factual claims (numbered list)
    - Brief context for each claim
    
    Keep it focused and concise - only the claims that matter most.

fact_checking_task:
  description: >
    Verify ONLY the top 2-3 claims identified in the content analysis.
    
    EFFICIENCY RULES:
    1. Focus ONLY on the most important claims
    2. Use targeted searches - search for each claim specifically
    3. Stop searching once you find 2-3 credible sources per claim
    4. Don't over-research - get enough evidence to make a determination
    
    For each claim:
    1. Do ONE targeted search for the specific claim
    2. Check 2-3 credible sources (news sites, fact-checkers, official sources)
    3. Determine: TRUE, FALSE, MISLEADING, or UNVERIFIED
    4. Move to next claim
    
    Be FAST and FOCUSED. Quality over quantity.
  expected_output: >
    A focused fact-check analysis containing:
    
    For each of the TOP 2-3 claims:
    - Claim statement
    - Verification status (TRUE/FALSE/MISLEADING/UNVERIFIED)
    - 2-3 key pieces of evidence with sources
    - Source URLs and dates
    
    Keep it concise - only essential evidence that supports the verdict.

report_generation_task:
  description: >
    Create a final fact-check report with EXACTLY these four sections:
    
    1. EXPLANATION (3-5 lines): Summarize the main claim and verdict
    2. EVIDENCE (focused): Only include evidence for the TOP claims
    3. FINAL VERDICT (ONE sentence): State if the main claim is TRUE or FALSE
    4. CONFIDENCE SCORE (0-100%): Calculate based on the scoring guide below
    
    CONFIDENCE SCORE CALCULATION GUIDE:
    - 90-100%: 3+ authoritative sources (official govt, major news, peer-reviewed), no conflicting evidence
    - 80-89%: 2-3 reliable sources, minor gaps in evidence, mostly consistent
    - 70-79%: 1-2 sources, some gaps, or minor conflicting reports
    - 60-69%: Limited sources, significant gaps, or mixed evidence
    - 50-59%: Weak evidence, only social media or unverified sources
    - Below 50%: Insufficient evidence, major contradictions, or unverifiable claims
    
    BE REALISTIC with scoring. Consider:
    - Source reliability (official > major news > blogs > social media)
    - Evidence completeness (full context vs partial information)
    - Conflicting evidence (deduct points for contradictions)
    - Recency of sources (recent evidence is more reliable)
    
    KEEP IT CONCISE. Focus on the most important evidence that supports the verdict.

    A structured fact-check report in markdown format:
    
    # Fact-Check Report
    
    **Content URL:** {video_url}
    **Content Type:** [Video/Blog/Article]
    **Analysis Date:** [Current Date]
    
    ## 1. EXPLANATION
    [Write exactly 3-5 lines: What is the main claim? What did we find? Is it true or false?]
    
    ## 2. EVIDENCE
    
    ### Claim 1: [Main claim from content]
    **Status:** [TRUE/FALSE/MISLEADING/UNVERIFIED]
    
    **Key Evidence:**
    [2-3 paragraphs with the most important evidence. Be specific but concise.]
    
    **Sources:**
    - [Source 1] - [URL] (Date)
    - [Source 2] - [URL] (Date)
    - [Source 3] - [URL] (Date)
    
    [Include Claim 2 only if it's critical to the verdict]
    
    ## 3. FINAL VERDICT
    [ONE sentence: Is the main claim TRUE or FALSE? Be clear and direct.]
    
    ## 4. CONFIDENCE SCORE
    [Calculate using the guide: 90-100% for 3+ authoritative sources, 80-89% for 2-3 reliable sources, 70-79% for limited sources, etc.]
    [Number]%
    
    IMPORTANT: Do NOT default to 100%. Honestly assess the evidence quality.
    Format as markdown without code blocks. Be concise and focused.
